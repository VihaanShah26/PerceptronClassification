# PerceptronClassification

## Background
Predicting a smart-phone's password based on accelerometer data from the phone. 
Pressing different buttons on the phone causes different signals in the accelerometer. 
There is training data where where each data point is the x,y values sensed by the accelerometer and the label is the number that is pressed (0-9).

Goal - Build a classifier using a perceptron that can classify the button being pressed by looking at the accelerometer data. (Accuracy: greater than 95%)

Assumption - Decision boundary goes through the origin.
